  <h1>Why I Am Starting This Blog</h1>

  <p>
    I decided to start writing blog posts to improve my writing skills, which I feel have been gradually declining with heavy AI usage. This blog is a space for me to express ideas I've long postponed, away from the politicized and algorithm-driven nature of today's social platforms. I also want to document topics I'm learning, and hopefully, share something valuable with others along the way.
